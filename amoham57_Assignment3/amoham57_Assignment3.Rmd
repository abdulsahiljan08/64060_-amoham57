#Now we Compare this value with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B). Which is a more #accurate estimate?
#Value we got from question 2 was 0.0984556 and in the question 5 is 0.1000861 are almost same. The only difference between by the exact method and naive bayes method is the exact method would need the exact same independent variable classification to predict, whereas the naive bayes method does not. We can confirm that the value get from the question 2 is more accurate. Since we have taken the exact values from the pivot table.

#Which of the entries in this table are needed for computing P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1)?
#Now we Run naive Bayes on the data. Examine the model output on training data, and find the entry #that corresponds to P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1). Compare this to the number you #obtained in (E).
```{r}
NB.mod <- naiveBayes(Personal.Loan ~ Online + CreditCard, data = train_df)

#The value we got from question 7 is 0.09206369 and value derived from the task 5 is 0.1000861. # the result is almost same that we got from Task5. # There is only a minute difference because of the rounding. #The difference will not effect the rank order of the output.
